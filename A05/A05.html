            <p>Welcome to the Fantasy Football Draft of ADED 2015!</p>
            <p>This year's draft has been quite the exciting draft yet!</br>
            <p>For the first time ever, the twelve original players from the 2014 season
               has returned, and this time the stakes are higher.</p>
            <p>With over $700 for the season winnings, the rules are still the same. However,
               changes within the system has occured to keep this tradition going. Changes such
               as the auction system for the waiver wire has been implemented. A dynasty player
               is now in effect for the next year's draft. Which means the returning players
               next year will be able to keep one player at their final team roster in January.
               The draft system is still the same with Yahoo being our main draft tool.</p>
            <p>The returning champion, Dave, became the first ever two time champion.</p>
            <p>What will this football season provide? Who knows? We shall see as the next
               sixteen weeks to the championship if he will keep his crown as Champion.</p>
            <p>The order on the left is the order of the draft from last year's last place to first place.
               </p>
