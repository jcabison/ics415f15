    <div class="faqBoxes" id="faq1" style="border: solid black; background-color: #CCCCCC">
        All walks of life partake in the journey to achieving the mythical ICS degree here in UH Manoa.
        <br>
        However, while many enter the ICS field with high hopes and dreams. Only a few make it out with
        <br>
        the prized degree. While many who enter the UH Manoa campus with hopes and dreams, a true ICS
        <br>
        student will enter and leave with ways and means.

    </div>
    <div class="faqBoxes" id="faq2" style="border: solid black; background-color: #CCCCCC">
        The student must first speak to the ICS Elder god, Gerald Lau, for he has the power and ability to allow
        <br>
        the student embark on their journey. Along their journey, they must find income to provide the items they
        <br>
        need in order to complete their ICS dream. Items such as a Laptop and software are needed. One does not
        <br>
        simply attain these items and realize it is easy. One must collect the mystical Monster energy drinks, for
        <br>
        the elixir it contains allows the student to power through in the darkest of nights and earliest of mornings.

    </div>
    <div class="faqBoxes" id="faq3" style="border: solid black; background-color: #CCCCCC">
        There are many paths a young padawan of the ICS field could go through. Many have chosen the path of the BS route,
        <br>
        some to the BA route, the IT route, and the bio-informatic route. While there are many roads in life a young ICS padawan
        <br>
        has before them, one must consider that once a path is chosen that they can never turn back. For it is unwise to invest
        <br>
        so much time and currency to waste it all and shorten their path mid way. An old, wise student once told his friend this
        <br>
        message, "just f'ing do it".

            <a href="javascript:showonlyone('faq4')">FAQ #4: What will I encounter in the ICS field?</a>
        </div>
        <div class="faqBoxes" id="faq4" style="border: solid black; background-color: #CCCCCC">
            The yound padawan will encounter many challenges along their path in finding that ICS degree. It will test their
            <br>
            limits, patience, faith, endurance, and perseverence. The journey is never an easy one. For one shall endure
            <br>
            the gates of ICS 111 and 211, where the requirements is a B and above to move on. Many have gone through this gate, yet
            <br>
            many have decided to end their journey while a few fight through the struggle. The pain has not gone away yet for the
            <br>
            monster lurking in ICS 311 called Algorithms is awaiting for dinner to arrive and eat upon the hopes and dreams of
            <br>
            many ICS students. The torturous, painful feeling of lost hope, confusion, anger, and utter sadness comes pressing down
            <br>
            on the hearts of students who walk through the gates of ICS 311. It is truly where the crossroads of students decide to turn
            <br>
            away and move onto a newer, different path. However, not all is lost. Once a padawan has moved passed these gates of Hell,
            <br>
            the light of the heavens shine upon them as they're into the clear and into newer, different pastures of the ICS field.

        <div class="faqBoxes" id="faq5" style="border: solid black; background-color: #CCCCCC">
            The journey may seem daunting, relentless, and often times depressing. However, a student slowly becomes a journeyman of the
            <br>
            field and gains immense knowledge during their journey. One will acquire the many known languages of the computer world at their
            <br>
            disposal, providing themselves the necessary tools given to them by the elder professors. The knowledge of time and efficiency is
            <br>
            another weapon of choice used at any given notice. The power of talk and manipulation to capture the enemy's data, a dark power taught
            <br>
            and used for the Hacking Sorcerers. IT Enchantresses are made from the student themselves to provide safety and protection for their party.
            <br>
            Many who walk the life of an ICS student will leave UH Manoa and hold the power in changing the world, economically, socially, and technologically.
            <br>
            While the journey is frowned upon and the road less taken, those who endure the journey will be the ones that can say "yeah, we did it."
